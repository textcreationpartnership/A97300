            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the desire of <hi>Augustine</hi> to have seene Christ in the flesh, <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, <hi>Rome</hi> in her glory, things that could not be attained; but what Christian is there who is not glad to see Pulpits furnished with men of <hi>Pauls</hi> spirit, who carry the message of Christ in their mouthes, the image of Christ in their lives, the marks of Christ in their bodies, and setup Christ in his Throne in their writings? and would not be glad to see Christ, not in the flesh, but in his power riding on his white horse, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. with his bow and arrowes in his hand conquering his enemies, and ruling his people with his golden Scepter? to see <hi>Rome</hi> not in her glory, but ruins, downfall of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> with all that Antichristian faction? to w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> purpose give me leave to commend this little Treatise to thee; the maine scope whereof is to give notice to the world that Christ is up &amp; at work to make way for his cōming, wherein the Author hath taken in hand to lay down the signes of it, both from the word and workes of God, that he is not far off; and truely the great shakings that now are in all Christendom, &amp; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in these Islands, foreshew that God is about some great worke, &amp; will shake down (his house) that rotten frame of Hierarchy &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian government before hee have done, and not leave till hee have made way for such materialls as may make way for a better building then formerly; and that there shall be a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwels righteousnesse, and that there shall be not onely a reformation, but a resurrection of Christians in the world. Oh how welcome would that day be to the godly, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove when she brought the Olive leafe in her mouth, or the reappearing of the Star to the wise men, as a returne after a tedious storme to the Mariner! Amongst the many truthes that are abroad, very few have taken any paines in this subject, which is of as great concernment as any one for the present, and therefore thou maist take some paines to reade over and weigh the scope of the Author; let us adde our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to the work, by praying, beleeving, and laying downe the old way of superstition, if we may be ready to receive Christ when he doth come, to further him up to his Throne, and bid him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>

               <item>3. The intention and ayme of the Author.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, for the Psalme it selfe, the illustration of verse 1. may serve for Preface touching the Psalme in generall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, touching the matter handled from thence in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it is for substance a harmony and conference of the Scriptures for clearing the scope of this Propheticall Psalme, and minde of the Spirit of God, in what is there written for our instruction.</p>
            <p>And these Scriptures are most part prophecies of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, conferred with the new, and almost every where with the rest of the divine Oracles.</p>
            <p>In reading of the Prophecies we finde, first, some things which have both a spirituall and literall sense, where the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sense hath beene usually received, and the literall reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of most interpreters, as in most of the Prophecies concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Jewes conversion and comming in to Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of the flourishing and spreading of Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the world. Secondly, some things have a literall sense onely, and yet taken mystically of many, as most of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies concerning the Jewes returne to their owne Country, and
<pb facs="tcp:112554:3"/> possessing it in outward prosperitie in a flourishing happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this world. Thirdly, some Prophesies have beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be fulfilled and past, which here thou shalt finde never yet fulfilled, and bee yet to come, and belong to the time of Christs kingdome in the later dayes. Fourthly, some Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which are sayd in the new Testament to be fulfilled, are but yet in part fulfilled, and have a further reach then we have beene aware of, for Christs kingdome is not yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished (saith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon <hi>Esay</hi> very frequently) and though they have beene taken as fulfilled plenarily under the Gospell, it is true in part; but so as yet the Gospell hath a further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then we have yet seene or attayned to; and many things in it, as well as in the old Testament, have a further reach then we have beene aware of, even to the time of the complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Christ kingdome in the later dayes, in the glorious estate of the new Church, after the ruine of Rome, the Jewes full conversion, and spreading thence to the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>That such a glorious state of the Church shall be, is clearely evinced by these reasons. First, the Scriptures teach us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that the Churches enemies who have long flourished in peace and prosperity, rage and tyranny over the Saints, shall at length be plagued and utterly destroyed. Secondly, it suits with Gods Justice, to render vengeance to them, and rest and peace to the Church even in this world. Thirdly, it suits with Christs kingly glory and honour to make his Church, his kingdome glorious before hee resigne it to the Father. Fourthly, God hath promised this to Christ and his deare bought Church as a reward of his and their sufferings in this world. Fiftly, experience of former great deliverances teach it. Sixtly the fall of Antichrist at hand, and the beginnings of Romes ruine leade to it. Seventhly, strange signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the world of late are forerunners of it. Eightly, the changes and alterations the Lord Jesus is daily working in the world, are lively effects of his working in the remote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and preparations to his kingdome: all which in the
<pb facs="tcp:112554:3"/> ensuing treatise thou shalt finde cleared from the Scriptures, and we confidently expect to bee fulfilled by such wayes and meanes as men least thinke of; when the Church is at last gaspe, overwhelmed and given for lost in all humane eyes, then Christs Arme shall put on strength as in the dayes of old and worke salvation, <hi>Isay 51.</hi> and 59. 17. then his workes breake out in the world, he will doe great things, <hi>Joel 2. 21.</hi> when he arises to build his <hi>Zion,</hi> he will appeare in his glory, and will be glorious in his workes to the ends of the earth: for betweene Christs first appearing in the flesh and his last ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to judgement, there is a middle or second appearing of his, as <hi>Alfonsus Mantuanus</hi> and others say, which they call his virtuall comming to ruine Antichrist and restore the Church. And whereas here our Psalme affords us frequent matter of treating of the Churches low estate in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: the Wildernesse I conceive to be every place where the Saints are oppressed and hunted of the enemies like wild beasts for rage and madnesse, so greedy of their prey as grudge the Saints the very common ayre to breath in, gape and some with rage to devoure them: and so the Wildernesse is not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abiding place from their rage and malice, though God even there provides some corners of more safety to some then to others; for the Lord hath promised to make the same Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse a place of rest and safetie, yea a Paradise of all felicity in the end, <hi>Isa. 35. 1. Chap. 51. 2, 3. Cant. 7. 11. Ezek. 34. 12.</hi> to 29. 3. Lastly touching the intent and ayme of the Author, who having sustained some share in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches sorrowes, and bitter troubles many yeares, tossing in tempests and floods of great waters, in a part of the world, to him a Wildernesse, under the rage and malice of all sorts of oppressors in Church and Commonweale, like wild beasts hunting for their prey, where he some yeares agoe by their rage and malice, with a violent tempest was driven into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corner of the world, where he found himselfe but still in another part of the Wildernesse, where in his weary pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb facs="tcp:112554:4"/> he studied to finde out some ground and footing of some future rest, at least to his hopefull posteritie, even in this world; where he first composed these meditations in his sad condition and exile, from whence with shipwracke in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate, he is now at last wet and weather beaten, through some hazards of person too, returned to his countrey, in little better then exile, still from his disconsolate family, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Lord Jesus daily working forward in his worke of renovation of all things, in some remote beginnings of his kingdome in the world, according to his weake sight and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he could no longer neglect to communicate such things to others, as were the chiefe stay and support of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed spirits in his bitter troubles: which now he hath also lately revised, seriously examined, and found comfortably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, from the daily workings of the Lord Jesus, towards the setting up of his kingdome to the comfort and consolation of all who waite for redemption in the Churches restauration and full deliverance. If thou that readest be one that hath had a share in the Churches troubles, then here is some good newes will be welcome to thee: who ever thou art, if a sincere Christian, thou mayst finde somewhat to thy information, and furtherance of future consolation: if any thing suite not with thy judgement or affection, waite on God who may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale it in due time; Judge nothing rashly, but bury it in that love which thinketh none evill: In which love I leave thee not willing longer to detaine thee in too large an entrance, from looking into the varieties following.</p>

                  <hi>Prayer</hi>] not ordinary but extraordinary,<note place="margin">1. A prayer not ordinary, but extraordinary. Vers. 1. <hi>Beza.</hi> Argument upon this Psal.</note> and in time of great extremity, as wee shall see anon; who was the Author or Penman of it, or when it was penned, we finde nothing in the Scriptures, some of the Learned have conceived it to bee written by <hi>Daniel</hi> about the time of the Jewes captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and belongs, saith learned <hi>Beza,</hi> to the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times of the Church, as appeares clearely by <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. 15. and seemes to have some relation to that fervent Prayer of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 9. and to resemble the state of the Church menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. about the time of the calling of the Jewes, and uniting of the ten Tribes with the other two, about which time it is like there shall be great troubles in the world. <hi>Beza</hi> his judgement of this <hi>Psalme</hi> is, that there is no writing upon this Argument comparable to it, wherein the state of the Church in great extremitie, and also spreading in admired glory and great majesty through the world under Christ, is most lively set forth, by the spirit of prophesie.</p>
               <p>And who more like to be the Author of so excellent a piece, then <hi>Daniel?</hi> one that had so lively a sense of the Churches sorrowes, and had such high and excellent things revealed to him concerning her delivery, so that we may say of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Old Testament, and of <hi>John</hi> in the New, who ever had more heavenly visions of the mysteries of Christs kingdome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112554:6"/> and glory of it in the last times, then they? none excelled them herein. <hi>Daniel,</hi> a man of an excellent spirit for wisedome and understanding to finde out the high and hidden mysteries of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 11. and Chap. 6. 3. <hi>Daniel</hi> greatly beloved of God: and hee againe dearely loves the Church of God, and sustaines her sorrowes, spends himselfe in fasting and Prayer, and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sometimes full three weekes of dayes, for her miseries: and by unwearied study searches out the time of her delivery, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2. and 10. 3.</p>
               <p>In all the booke of God wee finde not a more cleare and compendious description of the state of the Church in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes, in her lowest and deepest extremity, and height of her transcendent joy in the sight of her King appearing in his glory, then in this Psalme; as it is written, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44. All things concerning him must bee fulfilled which were written in the Law, and the Prophets, and in the Psalmes. Amongst which, this is one of the principall pieces, and can no way without violence to the truth and Spirit of God, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall penner of it, be limited to the state of the Church in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and her delivery thence, as wee shall clearely see in the following Verses, and is clearely applyed to the time of Christs Kingdome, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10. from the 26, 27, 28. Verses of this Psalme.</p>
               <p>Some of the Jewish <hi>Rabbines</hi> apply this prophesie of the state of the Church to their present exile and scattered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and promised restauration and returne to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and their owne country: The Lord open their eyes to see him whom they have pierced, and to seeke after Jehovah their God, and <hi>David</hi> their King in these latter dayes, <hi>Jer. 30. 9. Hos.</hi> 3. 5. Concerning the Author or time of penning this Psalme, it is not for us to bee too curious to enquire, where the holy Spirit is silent, it is sufficient that it is penned by the Spirit of God, as a lively portraiture of the Church in these latter dayes, in her humiliation and exaltation of Christs Kingdome, which should be the subject of our deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est meditations, and choicest thoughts, daily prayers, desires and longing after it, and shall by Gods assistance be our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest study, to observe from hence as it may be cleared by the Scriptures, for the consolation of all that partake in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches bitter troubles, and waite for redemption in <hi>Ierusalem, Luke</hi> 2. 38.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:112554:6"/>
               <p>The next thing in this prayer is the persons for whom,<note place="margin">2. For whom, for the poore afflicted Church. 3. When, in time of great extremity, when the Church is even wasted and spent, sunke and gone in all mens eyes.</note> [<hi>For the poore</hi>] that is, the poore afflicted Church, or of the poore afflicted Church as some render it, the sense is all one as the next words declare.</p>
               <p>3. The time when, [<hi>When he] i. e.</hi> the Author or penman, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayning the person of the poore afflicted Church, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> did, <hi>Lam. 3. 1. [Is overwhelmed</hi>] grievously and greatly afflicted in sorrowes of all sorts, outward and inward tryalls, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 61. 2. like a Ship tossed in tempests in the deepe waters, often cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the lofty waves, up and downe, and often sunke under water in all mens eyes, all the waves goe over and over her, sunke and gone and given for lost; the word implies such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church as when all is turned upside downe in a forlorne condition, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 3. and 142. 3. and 143. 4. &amp; is more then cleare in the complaints that follow, of enemies reviling continually, sworne and madly raging against the Church, unto bonds and appointment to death, consuming as smoake, as a shadow declined and gone, the long continuance of afflictions having almost worne out the remembrance of her, body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, strength wasted, bones burnt up like an hearth, radicall moisture spent in sorrowes and teares continually, and in this distresse forsaken of friends and driven into the wildernes to be a<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 17.</note> companion to Owles, &amp; continually mourning as a Sparrow for want of her mate; watching all the long winter night of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in stormes and tempests, &amp; all weathers, winds blowing, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters raging, the heavens sending downe thunder and lightning, the sense of her Lords indignation, of all other troubles the most troublesome, as wee shall see in the following Verses, and is not she now overwhelmed? I, but not sunke yet, her head is in heaven, she cannot be drowned, you shall see the storme cease by and by, <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. by her Jehovahs arising.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And powreth forth</hi>] 4. Here we have the manner of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<note place="margin">4 Thing in this prayer is the manner of it, and that is very remarkable.</note> prayer sutable to her extremity, illustrated by a similitude taken from a vessell overcharged with new wine or strong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, that bursts for vent; Oh the heart bursting cries, shee sends out all the day, as wee shall see anon. Here is no lazy, slothfull, lip labour stinted formes of prayer, no empty sounds of verball expressions, which can never procure her a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble answer from her God, or the least ease to her burthened soul; but powred out prayers as <hi>Hanna, 1 Sam.</hi> 1. 15. and <hi>Ieremy, Lam.</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112554:7"/> 2. 12. pressed forth with vehemence of spirit, and heart pangs of inward griefe: thus the Lord deales with his Church, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ere he powre out cups of consolation, they must powre out teares in great measure.</p>
               <p>Observe here by the way, that times of the Churches trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are times of teares, times of the Churches great affliction, are times of bitter weeping and mourning, times of exile and banishment of the Church into the Desert, and solitary mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life in the Wildernesse, are times for frequent and fervent prayers. It is a sad thing that in these times of the Churches bitter troubles, few lay to heart her miseries, few helpe her with vehement and fervent prayers. On the contrary how deepely the true Prophets and Servants of God have beene affected with the Churches miseries, See <hi>Isa. 22. Lam. 1. Ier. 4. 21. 31. Dan.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And in this deepe musing meditation of her sad condition, she calls to minde her former priviledges in the dayes of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, comparing it with her present misery, <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 7. and this aggravates her sorrowes exceedingly, the sense of her Jehovahs indignation for abuse of high privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges wherewith she was lifted up, but now cast downe to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extremities; for sinnes against kindnesse are sinnes with a witnesse, highly incense the Lords anger, and bring upon a person or people the sharpest afflictions, though not utter ruine<note place="margin">6.

               <p>
                  <hi>Before Jehovah</hi>] 6. Here wee have the person to whom the Church in her extremity powreth forth her sore complaints in prayer, and it is to her Jehovah, so applyed as her God, yea her strong God, <hi>Vers.</hi> 25. This name Jehovah is full of divine mysteries of his eternall essence and being of himselfe; in and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112554:7"/> from whom all created nothings in the world receive their being, as from a full, perfect and pure fountaine. The Jewes pretend such reverence to this name Jehovah, as they dare not use it in their Synagogues, but in stead thereof read <hi>Adonai,</hi> Lord, at the naming of which they leape, and daunce in expectation of their deliverance out of their wandering condition by the comming of their conceited Messias.</p>
               <p>This name Jehovah the Church is directed to put up her peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto in her extremity, signifies his faithfulnesse in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his free &amp; gracious promises for her deliverance in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 4.

                  <hi>Tremelius,</hi> whose version I follow, expounds <hi>Jehovah</hi> here in this Psalme, to be meant of Christ the second person, to whose kingly office &amp; administration it belongs, to deliver his Church, for the Father hath committed all judgement to the Sonne, <hi>Joh.</hi> 22. Coeternall with the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>And when the Church by an eye of Faith sees a gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of her prayers, and by a beame of new light hath seene in the spirit her Jehovahs rising to have mercy on his <hi>Zion</hi> in the appointed time of the accomplishment of his promises, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of her enemies, and conversion of Jewes and Heathen, and spreading of his kingdome from East to West, <hi>Vers.</hi> 17.

               <p>As it is the wisedom of the Spirit of God to direct his Church in all conditions to invocate him in such names and attributes, as most suite with her necessities, and his workings for her, so it should bee our wisedome and Christian dexteritie, in powring out our prayers, in our owne or the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches extremities, to select, and choose such names of God and of his attributes, as most suite with our present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in extremities, or greatest joyes.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:112554:12"/>
               <p>[<hi>Arising</hi>] as one out of slumber and sleeping, as if he had see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med long to neglect his Church, and not regard her troubles, but it is but in corrupt natures sense, his arising promises her speedy helpe in his owne time, and according to his antient Counsells and will, as is plaine by the set or determined time of his comming; her time of greatest and utmost extremitie, is his opportunitie, to get himselfe the greatest glory in her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when she is at last gaspe, lost and gone, in all humane eyes; so as her enemies assure themselves that the day is theirs, and her remembrance shall be no more; then he arises, and not till then. As a mighty King, or Generall of an Army rouses up himselfe on a suddaine upon newes of danger of the Inrode, and Invasion of a potent enemy, that will admit no delay, the losse of his Kingdome, of his Army lies upon it, hee is now upon a great designe, to doe some famous worke in the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and subdue all his enemies, growing to a great height through his long patience towards them, and his absence from his Church for her wandrings, and abuse of his favours. But when he now comes he comes to purpose; he is said to arise as a man after wine, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 65. in great rage and fury at his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies insolencie, he comes skipping over the mountaines, and leaping upon the hils, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 8. trampling upon the mighty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, in higher and lower authoritie, Antichrist and Turke, and all their kingly authority; hee comes in the very nicke of time, when she cal'd and cry'd, so long, so vehemently, powring forth her complaints to him with cups of teares, spent and gone; and now sure he will be most welcome, she now will prise him, love him and never let him goe; his absence, his hiding his face hath beene so bitter to her, and therein the sense of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation for abuse of his favours, and high priviledges, had brought her low to grievous extremities, and almost quite sunk her, so that if he had come sooner, she should not have beene so sensible of his love, power, and might in her deliverance, and therefore now it is surely a joyfull sight for her to see her long absent estranged husbands beames of light, appearing in the tempestuous morning, that Sunne of righteousnesse arising out of the cloud with healing under his wings, <hi>Malachi</hi> 4. 2. with a cure for all her inward and outward diseases and distempers, as we shall see from <hi>Vers.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Here she gets a gracious answer of all her sore complaints, a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112554:12"/> rich returne of her fervent prayers; and here observe the great gaine and sweet profit that comes in from fervent prayer; when a Merchants ship, and stocke comes home from a long and dangerous voyage with great increase; what great joy? how sweet is that gaine? Lo here now the great gaine of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches praying trade. But by the way observe that trade that brings in such gaine must be a constant trade, of great adventures, of many hazards, and a skilfull trade, full of dexteritie in choyse of wares, and observing fit seasons, to send out in, and then all is done, there is no feare of bad market, bad debts, or losses by factors, or danger of Seas, the Lord Jesus is the factor, he takes the adventure of all upon him and assures all, if thou send him but wares according to his order, be sure of a rich returne, gold for dust, pearles for pebles, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 24. the gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> for the stones of the river; for all the wares we can send him, are of no more use or value to him then pebles, but to shew him our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingnesse, our povertie and weakenesse of our estates, it is his onely desire to uphold our trade of nothing, and make us rich of nothing; the wares he desires to trade in and make us rich by, are onely such as carry the stamps and marks of our wants and weakenes and extreame necessities, he cannot abide a proud heart or a high thought of any thing in us to enrich our selves by, or that may make us seeme any thing of our selves, or flatter us in any hope of subsistence in our selves, or lazy sloathfull stinted formes of prayer, or verball expressions, such wares are worth nothing at this great Mart of his, they are for nought but for the fire, vex and grieve him, and will make him send backe the ship of thy soule emptie and weatherbeaten, to thy great damage and losse of all thy cost and time, to learne the more skill in thy trade. We see here what wares the Church traded in, Verse 2. to 13. these are such as her Jehovah delights in, and brought her home this rich returne. Send him fardles of every sort of sorrowes, with variety of complaints from a broken spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, these he delights in; yea they must bee stamped with the sense of sinne, and some with the very sense of his indignation and fervent wrath, and some with heart-bursting love towards him, and longing for a gracious answer from him; O these are rich wares in his esteeme, hee will looke them over and over often, to see what needs to be returned for them. These please him, make roome in the soule for him to exercise his skill; here
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112554:13"/> is worke for him to shew his Excellencies, to exchange with us for our emptinesse, here is roome for his heavenly trade, send him great vessels full of teares, and he will send them home full of Nectar, sweet delicious wines, of cordiall comforts to make glad thy heart, and fainting spirits in greatest straits, in a sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition; his wines tast of the sweet soyle they grow in, even of his unchangeable nature that refresh the fainting spirits, and this is the Churches trade here, hath brought her a rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, she sends out strong cries and long cries too with hidious mourning as the birds of the Desert, and she gets here a sweet echo, a joyfull sound of Christs comming to have mercy on <hi>Zion</hi> in the appointed time, the returne of her prayer now comes home like <hi>Salomons</hi> ships from <hi>Ophir,</hi> with Gold, Myrrhe and Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, sweet odours, and rich stones, to make her mighty and magnificent, glorious with costly ornaments, adorned with spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Diamonds, beseeming this stately bride and Spouse of so great a King, as wee shall see in the things that follow in this Psalme, when all her rich returnes are landed &amp; opened out, this 14. Verse brings the first newes of their arrivall with the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazoone of the rich lading, all safely returned and ready for landing.</p>
               <p>Happy time she may now say, that ever she was distressed and overwhelmed in extremities, to cause her learne this gainefull trade of sending out such wares as bring home such a rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.

O what will the wedding be, the divine musick, the marriage song, the going home with the bridegroome and his paranymphs to the Fathers Mansions! is not all this worth her suffering long, all the rage and revilings of enemies, and all other troubles?</p>
               <p>This is now at this day the very Churches trade here descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and we waite and watch for the rich returne, wee hope to heare some good newes of it ere wee have done; to tell among the nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 2. what the Lord hath proclaimed to the ends of the earth, Tell the daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> behold thy salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth, behold his reward is with him, and his workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 11.

But he will comfort <hi>Zion,</hi> he will comfort her wast places, and make her Wildernesse like <hi>Eden,</hi> and her Desert like the Garden of God: joy and gladneffe shall be found in her, and the voyce of melody, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 3. Yea he will comfort her, as one whom his mother comforteth, and ye shall be comforted in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoyce and your bones shall flourish as an hearbe, and the hand of the Lord shall bee knowne towards his servants, and his indignation towards his enemies, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 13. 14.</p>
               <p>And is not this good newes, as cold waters to a weary soule? <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 25. And thanke fervent prayer for bringing it; yet must we not sit downe at rest as if all were done, we must still watch for the signes of his comming, and call and cry, and set all the Saints a praying untill he be come indeed; a strong gale of prayer would hasten him, and bring him quickly, riding upon the clouds, with great expedition to finish all our miseries, <hi>Psal. 68. 33. Deut.</hi> 33. 26.</p>
               <p>Thus of the Lord Jesus his comming, the next thing in the Text is the time of his comming.</p>
               <p>[<hi>For the appointed time is come</hi>] even the very set time his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells of old had determined, and set forth in the Scriptures, though darkely in our eyes, in regard of our originall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and mistaking of the Scriptures, while we sinfull men look upon them, and the workes of Christ in the accomplishing of them, in and through our darke vaile, of humane wisedome, and currupt sense, which make us so short sighted in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures brightnesse, to the dazling of our eyes, and dulling of our spirits, so as we walke heavily, not able to dive into the deepe mysteries of the Kingdome of Christ, wherein lies folded

               <p>We returne to the Text.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Wherein</hi>] That is, this appointed time of Christs comming to have mercy on <hi>Zion</hi> is the very time wherein the Saints of God are exceedingly delighted, expressed in these words, [<hi>thy servants</hi>] the Ministers and labourers in the Lords husbandry, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9.</p>

Oh what a deare esteeme had he of it? So should nothing be too deare for us to bestow on the poore bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, Jewes &amp; Gentiles, both together at this day in a low condition, how base so ever they seeme in the eyes of the world, as what is of more vile esteeme then the dust men tread upon?</p>
               <p>The Church brings in here this sad representation of her members scattered &amp; trampled upon in the world as an argument of her confidence of her Jehovahs arising for her deliverance even in his appointed time, even such a time wherein his anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent family, her children and servants, are ruined, scattered, and all gone to wracke; so as if his servants pity the ruines of his family and children, much more will he be moved to pity, and come speedily, he now must needs arise and helpe them, though she hath beene a wanderer after many lovers, she mournes now for that wofull separation, and useth such perswasive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his returning home to her, as beseemes a mother of hopefull children, whom she knowes hee can doe enough for; and the poore mother driven to great extremities, sees her wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and hath beene long sensible of his indignation manifested by his long absence, now she invites him home with all the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, perswasions, and motives a poore dejected Spouse can use to her husband, willing even to creep in the dust to meete him, and he is of so good a nature, so perfect, so sweet a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112554:15"/> and tender affection, as he cannot stay longer from her, for it is now high time to helpe her, to pity his family, yea it is his owne time, his set time to favour her.</p>
               <p>Now to find out this prick or point of the appointed time here prophesied, is the grand difficulty, the great master piece; it is as small as a prick or point, and it is very hard to find it, there be so many crosse lines that runne thorough those lines that lead an direct us to it, as will cost some paines and a watchfull eye to hit the marke. Were wee once sure of this, wee should quickly see it goe well with the Church; I doe confesse it is one of the great difficulties, great scrutinies of these later dayes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most impossible in humaine eyes; yet being one of the revealed mysteries of God, may be found out by the Spirit of God, which searcheth the deepe things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. and by fasting and prayer, and much paines and watchfulnesse, must onely be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by searching the word, and observing the workes of God, the goings and doings of the Lord Jesus in the world, in these times of the Churches bitter troubles, and by his working wee must finde out the signes of his comming; when he turnes his word into workes, we may see much of his royall minde.</p>
               <p>But this discovery I confesse is a dangerous voyage, full of difficulties, because of the cloudy times and mists of ignorance arising out of the earth of our earthly minds and darkenesse of originall blindnesse, yet because the time approaches nearer dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, affording us some more incouragement, we will (<hi>Christo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>) put forth to Sea with the first faire gale of wind he shall please to fill our Sailes with, and advance forward on this dangerous voyage.</p>
               <p>The instruments we have for discovery are but few, yet sure and trusty, our Compasse, and Crosse staffe or Jacobs staffe; the Word is sure, as Silver seven times tryed and fined, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 6. our Jacobs staffe is the observation of the high and great workes of God, daily appearing in the world; and from thence we will see what we can finde out of Christs comming, the Churches Jehovah she sees here by the spirit of prophesie arising, to build his new <hi>Zion,</hi> to make new heavens, new earth, a new face of all things in the Church and world, in the new Jerusalem of the Jewes that comes downe from God in a heaven-like glistering glory, <hi>in summa</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. They must be men of rare and pretious spirits, choyse men, <hi>Pro. 17. 27. Dan. 6. 3.

                  <p>Thus wee see in the third place, what manner of men they must bee to whom the Lord Jesus will reveale these high mysteries, <hi>John</hi>-like men, Eagle-eyed men, of an excellent cleare sight, of an excellent nature, very spirituall, of a higher straine, above the common straine of the times, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the woman cloathed with the Sunne, the brightnesse of Christs Kingly glory, trampling the Moone, that is, earthly glory, and all sublunary things under their feet, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 1.

                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p>So now in these times of bitter troubles of the Church and persecution of the Saints, the Lord comes nearest to the suffering Saints, to his exiles.

All earthly things, yea the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affaires of the Church and present times that take up the mindes of most of the Saints, cannot content them, as too low for their high exalted Spirits, too meane for them to bestow their thoughts on, but with Eagles eyes and winged affections sore aloft towards this Sunne of righteousnesse, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 1. they will be prying into his brightnesse, with <hi>Moses, I beseech thee shew me thy glory, Exod.</hi> 19. 4. and 33. 18. and I will not rest untill hee shew them so much as they are capable of.

                  <p>We will take a walke (<hi>Christo duce</hi>) to these limpid waters of<note place="margin">Psal. 23. and 46.</note> repast, these Crystall streames which make glad the Citie of God, where the Elephant may swim and the Lambe may wade, drinke and coole their parched soules, fainting spirits in the greatest times of drought, according to the promise, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 8. There is enough to refresh the weake and feeble spirits, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the skill and art of the greatest Schollers, and wisest head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeces in the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the observation of the workes of Christ (as our <hi>Jacobs</hi> staffe) we may discover much of his mind; his workes are large comments upon his word, are the effects of his prophecies, and the fulfilling of his promises; when he turnes his word into workes, we may see much of his royall minde.</p>
                  <q>Mundi universitas est Deus explicatus.</q>
                  <p>The invisible things of God are clearely seene by the things
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112554:21"/> that are done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. if wee were well versed in this great booke of the workes of Christ, we should see more of the minde of Christ, there may wee finde his footsteps, his walkes, his wayes, his goings and doings in the world, as the great Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator of all things; and as he speakes to us by his word, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in his workes, he speakes aloud in our eares in these later dayes, especially when hee is about workes of wonder in the world about his kingdome; great Kings and Monarchs, are seene and knowne afarre off by their great workes and princely actions, as well as by their Edicts and Proclamations. <hi>The works of the Lord are great and glorious, sought out of all that have pleasure in them, Psal.</hi> 111. 4. They are a delightfull study to his true servants, call upon us for our observance and following of him, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, and the Lord Jesus againe delights to see his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants observe his movings, his doings in the world, in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his mercies, and to follow him in our affections and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. On the contrary, it is the greatest indignity we can doe to him when he is doing great workes for us, and wee regard them not, yea it is a brand marke of such as he intends to destroy, that they regard not his workes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 28. 5. And as the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs fall, and of the advancing Christs Kingdome growes nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the Lord Jesus his workes, as also his word, will shine forth clearer and be more transparent to all the Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Come then and behold the workes of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the earth, Psal.</hi> 46. 8. what desolations he hath made in <hi>Bohemia, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and those adjacent countries, since the time of the appearance of that wonderfull and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Comet, <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. when being in <hi>Germany</hi> we beheld its first arising in an unwonted forme, with its stupendious movings and removings from South-East, where it first appeared, to the South, West and North; and being shortly after comming for <hi>England</hi> and arrived in the Thames, wee found it right over our heads, which we beheld with great astonishment &amp; many sad thoughts, as importing many sad changes in the world, as we have seene and heard since, and as if its last influence might seeme to end in this Island, for after it blazed over <hi>England</hi> it was seene no more. Divers Astrologers in <hi>Germany</hi> writ upon this blazing Starre, amongst whom one noted man in Astrologie, <hi>Herlicius Stargar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densis</hi> did hold that its influence was like to continue betweene 20. and 30. yeares.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:112554:22"/>
                  <p>Now from the word and workes of God we will see what wee can discover of the mind of God, and observe what signes wee can see of the Lord Jesus his comming to build up his <hi>Zion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, praise to our skilfull Pilate, we have passed some of the dangers, and with a pleasant gale advanced to Cape <hi>Bon Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranze,</hi> or Cape of good hope, and here take in fresh water to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh our spirits, and with next faire Gale put forth to Sea againe, when the Spirit of Christ shall move upon the waters, there shall be light, and the dry land shall appeare, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. 9. and we get some sight of this unknowne shore, this land afarre off, that <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> never yet seene of mortall eyes.</p>

                  <p>There are severall Computations of times of the Churches delivery, by learned men from the Scriptures, whereof we will here say nothing, being assured from Christs owne mouth, that for the elects sake these dayes shall be shortned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 22. and therefore we conceive this the nearest way by his working in the world to finde out the appointed time, by the forerunners and signes of his comming.</p>
                  <p>All which computations for most part, agree in the time of the Jewes comming in about 1650. though the glory of Christs kingdome come not untill 45. yeares after, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11. which 45. yeares is like to be a time of great trouble to the new conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people.

                  <p>VVE are now come unto the last and greatest Difficultie of all to discover, by our observation of the workes of Christ in the world to finde out by his working the signes of his comming.</p>
                  <p>At Christs first appearing in the flesh, what a light came with him, shined very farre, that the wise men saw his starre in the East, and came to worship him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 2. sure they had a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sight of him that carryed them on in such a large distance from <hi>Chaldea,</hi> or <hi>Persia,</hi> to <hi>Iudea,</hi> to worship Christ in a manger in <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This troubled <hi>Herod</hi> the King and set all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare, fearing great alterations; <hi>Herod</hi> calls a Councell of Scribes and wise men to finde out where that Christ was to be borne, whom the Scriptures had spoken of, and craftily sought to slay him. Even so no doubt Antichrist the Pope and his crafty Councells at this time of Christs second comming doe see some forerunners of great changes in the world, making them shake in aguish fits, and have called up their Astrologers and wise men who can discerne by the face of the skie, that a storme is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon <hi>Rome</hi> from the brightnesse of Christs comming in his glory to set up his Kingdome, and therefore wee see the whole papacy and all their prelaticall partie in the world in an uproare fearing great alterations by the workes of Christ of late in the world, and therefore with all their craftie Counsells, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and bloody cruelties (as this Island and <hi>Ireland</hi> now are woefull witnesses) are up in their rage and resolutions to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and murther Christ in his members, and trouble his worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112554:23"/> What? a child borne in a manger trouble so great a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch as <hi>Herod,</hi> and make him affraid, and all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in an uproare, this made much to augment the glory of Christ in his humiliation, and lowest estate, <hi>Herod</hi> being not ignorant of the prophecies wherein the Jewes had a King promised them, who should rescue them out of their bondage and afflicted state under strange governors, and should swallow up and subdue all other kingdomes and government, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. which made him shake. Even so the signes and forerunners of Christs second comming to abolish Antichrist and set up his kingdome, in the least begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, must needs be very terrible to <hi>Rome</hi> and all her confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and set them a working to prevent her ruine, but all in vaine, for strong is the Lord who judgeth her, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. 8.</p>
                  <p>Before we come to the signes of Christs comming, it will be very usefull to consider of the manner of his second comming to set up his kingdome, and how the day of Christ so much spoken of in the Scriptures may be represented to our weake capacities, and how unto each part of the day of Christ, the severall ages, times and conditions of the Church, may most fitly be applyed.</p>
                  <p>He is sometimes set forth as the bright morning Star, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 19. Apoc.</hi> 22. 16. promised to the Church and faithfull overcommers, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 28. very comfortable and refreshing the weary Church in her pilgrimage and troublesome travaile to <hi>Zion,</hi> the sweet influence of this Starre of <hi>Jacob</hi> strengthens her fainting spirits in the darkesome stormy time of the morning of Christs day, and fills her heart with cordiall comforts, and her affections with joy in the expectation of a glorious day comming.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is set forth as the Sunne of Righteousnesse ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1, 2. a Sunne for glory and beauty for his Saints to looke upon, in whom is all fulnesse of light and life, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from his sweet influence; and a Sunne of Righteousnesse, because he comes to doe justice both to the Saints and to the enemies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 2. this day of Christs arising is said to have a cloudy morning, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1. wherein he will destroy his enemies roote and branch, but (Vers. 2.) unto the Saints who feare his name hee comes with healing under his wings, of all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers and diseases of soule and body, so as they shall goe out and grow as Calves of the stall, or fatlings under the Cow at the dugge continually, from whence they shall grow exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and shall faint no more.</p>

                  <p>Thus of the manner of his comming briefely as we finde it in the Scriptures. Now concerning the day of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The whole time of Christ since his first appearing in the flesh unto his resigning of his kingdome at the end of the world, would seeme to be but all one day of his, though distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in severall parts, to severall times and ages of the Church, <hi>Luk. 1. 78. Mal. 4. 5. Num.</hi> 24. 17. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 56. Himselfe saith <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyced to see my day and was glad; that is sure meant of his day from his first comming in the flesh to worke our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to the time of his raigne and kingdome amongst his Antients gloriously, <hi>Isa. 24. ult.</hi> and so we finde the prophets when they speake of Christs day, to joyne the beginnings in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, the progresse and perfection of it in his kingdome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as all in one day, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. and <hi>Psal. 69. Psal. 97. Isa. 11. Isa. 42. Zach.</hi> 3. 8. and 6. 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 5. and 33. 15. speaking of things farre distant in respect of time, as if they were all one, as is usuall in the Scriptures, his humiliation and time of his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reigne and kingdomes in the soules of men, and his visible reigne and kingdome amongst the Saints, being joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one day of Christ, including the whole course of his kingdome inward and outward to the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>And so this day of Christ hath its evening or more obscure<note place="margin">Two parts of Christs day.</note> part, and its morning or more glorious part of it as other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dayes have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5.</p>

Apoc.</hi> 21. 2.</p>
                  <p>And when the Prophets speake so often of the great glory of Christs day and kingdome, they have an eye upon this second part of it, as when they say it shall come to passe in that day, &amp;c. they meane that time or part of the day, by a <hi>Senecdoche membri;</hi> Sometimes called the day of Christs power, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 2. that is, that time of his day wherein he will shew his power visibly to all the world, overthrowing thrones and kingdomes of all his enemies, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 22. that he may be exalted in his kingdome, and be King of all the earth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 9. and sometimes the time of the last judgement is called the day of Christ, that is, that part or time of his day, &amp;c. day, and dayes being frequently taken for times, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 15. and <hi>cap. 24. 32. 37. Luke 17. 22. Act.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>All the glory of former times being swallowed up in this time of his reigne and visible kingdome amongst his ancient people the Jewes in great surpassing glory, <hi>Isa. 24. ult.</hi> unto which time or part of Christs day the Prophets usually attribute all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his day, as farre more transcendent and surpassing all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer glory of the Church or times, which now shall be buried in oblivion, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17.</p>
                  <p>And of this second part or time of Christs day, the Apostles also meane when they speake of Christs raigne and kingdome, as 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 1. Heb.</hi> 2. 5.</p>

                  <p>Two things here remaine to bee opened and unfolded for clearing this point.</p>
                  <p>First, when the enemy may be said to come in like a flood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is meant by the Spirit of the Lord lifting up a Standard against him, this terrible Ensigne to all the enemies.</p>
                  <p>The enemy may be said to come in like a flood.</p>
                  <p>First, when they at once in all the world make invasion, and inroades upon the Churches in severall nations, like a Land flood, or an inundation out of the Sea, swelling so high with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance as ready to overflow all the bankes of the Churches safetie and protection; and the Church overwhelmed and quite swallowed up in all humane sight.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when the foundations are cast downe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. the Lawes of kingdomes, and Lawes of God overthrowne, all wholesome governments in Church and Commonweale over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, which are the bankes and walls of the Church, then the enemy comes in as floods irresistibly; for when the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are cast downe, what can the righteous doe? <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. 5. when the Antichristian partie, Prelates, Priests and Jesuites, have wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted all the government out of the hands of the Magistrates, and Churches, and make them their servants to execute their wills and pleasures, and by this meanes rule the nations in anger, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 12. when they have corrupted all judicatures, overthrowne all Justice to make a prey of the Saints, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 15, 16. then the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie hath broke downe the bankes and comes in like a flood.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when the enemies are growne impudent in reviling, reproaching, raging, mad, and sworne against the Saints, and vow their destruction to rid their country of them, nay to make every trifle treason, suborne witnesses to take their lives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them to death, execute some as traytors, whose inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence could never be touched, burne, and brand, and mangle, cut Eares and Noses of Christs true witnesses, hunt and persecute other from place to place, from nation to nation, grudging them the very ayre to breath in, their rage so inflamed against them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112554:27"/> beyond and against all civill, all naturall bonds of blood and kindred, then the flood sure swells apace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when brother betrayes brother, and one kinsman another, but especially such as are professors, though time-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Religion, when these turne persecutors, and secretly are among and in the Councells of the enemies, such as have a heart &amp; a heart, one Religion for Summer, &amp; another for Winter, play Jack on both sides, sure on no side, but as the wind blowes, turne to the strongest side; When these are thus joyned with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Churches bitter troubles, the flood swells very high.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, when hell raiseth up the dead to helpe Antichrist and overthrow the Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. Kings, and Princes, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates who should be protectors of the Church, when they give their power to the Beast to wast the Church and Kingdome of Christ, then the Church is very low and the floods swell high: By raysing up the dead here is meant dead men in sinnes, and trespasses, that are still in their naturall state, and stand upon naturall principles, and have no life of Christ in them.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, when the power of Antichrist and his Catholike Son come in with their holy <hi>Armado</hi> to invade this land, as they did in <hi>October,</hi> 1639. and the Catholike Princes lay aside their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate quarrells and joyne in one designe against England that hath beene long the Bulworke and Fortresse of the Christian Churches abroad; and when our Philistim brood at home, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, Prelates, and their sonnes of the Church, and all the packe of Atheists &amp; confederates joyne in the designe to land the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to cut the throats of the Saints, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 83. 2. to blot out the remembrance of us, the flood then is swelled very high.</p>
                  <p>The nations about us looked on amazed, and who trembled not at the noyse of this flood, of this holy Fleet from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine;</hi> the power of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> to come rolling and tumbling in into our Channels, to our Bankes, like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation to swallow us up, and overflow this land, that hath beene the fortresse of the Christian Churches, and bounds to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaines</hi> ambition, which if it had once beene over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed, how soone would this flood of <hi>Romes</hi> power have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run all the other Churches, and subdued them to <hi>Romes</hi> grand Hierarchy, and <hi>Spaines</hi> long affected Monarchy of all the West? Who is so blind as not to see now the enemy comming in like a flood? and therefore they felt of the power of Christ the bright
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112554:28"/> morning Starre in his virtuall influence arising for us, and made the <hi>Hollander</hi> without us to take vengeance on these his enemies, so proud and contemptuous of the power of the <hi>Hollander,</hi> in regard of their great Gallyons, like Castles amongst the <hi>Flemish</hi> ships; now we may say in this great straite that Christ put on righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse for us, as an Habergion, and cloathing of vengeance to repay fury to these his proud enemies; let them that bee left alive goe home to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> and tell that Christ is risen to have mercy on <hi>Zion,</hi> and how they have felt the power of his strong Arme, and if they like this welcome, let them come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and try their fortunes.</p>
                  <p>This was sure a visible effect of Jehovahs arising to the prayer of the poore desolate Church in all the world, so greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this our delivery.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, In the last place we may bring other of the late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of the <hi>Romish</hi> partie against <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to regaine them to <hi>Romes</hi> subjection, and making the flood swell to its utmost height, as to engage <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall quarrell, to set us on fire, that they disguised as friends to helpe to quench the flame might get opportunitie to devoure the three nations at once; also the many secret plots to cut off the Protestants, the plots against the Nobles and Worthies now assembled in Parliament, the plots in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all which hitherto are so many certaine signes and effects of the Lord Jesus his arising for <hi>Zions</hi> deliverance. Thus was our estate before this happy Parliament.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the second thing to be cleared.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by the Lord Jesus his lifting up a Standard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: <hi>Tremel.</hi> reades the Spirit of the Lord shall invade them.</p>
                  <p>This Standard is sure that Ensigne of the Gospels light set up to the nations, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 12. a signe of astonishment to the wicked of the world, but of great acclamation and joy to his people to gather them together in his cause and quarrell▪ Some render it a signe to the nations, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> and others; a signe betokens strange things, great wonders to follow, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 8. if they will not heare the voyce of the signe, then followes greater wonders upon wonders, these signes speake a strange kind of language; when the Lord Jesus sets up his signes to the nations, let them looke about them, for great workes of wonder will assuredly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:112554:28"/> follow, these are his Harbingers, as more anon. Whether you reade it after our translation, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a Standard against them, or with <hi>Tremelius,</hi> the Spirit of Jehovah shall invade them, it is all one, for the Spirit of the Lord in the Gospell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>First, when the Romish whore is lifted up in pride and power, is set in the clefts of the Rockes, and be like the most High, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 14. and thinkes shee shall be most cocke-sure, sit as a Queene and never be moved, then shall her plagues come in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, for the Lord that judgeth her is a strong God, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. 7. then shall she come downe and sit in the dust, and no more bee called tender and delicate, <hi>Isa.</hi> 47. 1.

               <p>And that the wayes whereby the Lord Jesus will accomplish all this will be wonderfull, we shall see anon.</p>
               <p>But least these things should seeme to be but Cabbalisticall conceits, Rabbinicall constructions, and Jewish fables; wee begin with <hi>Paul,</hi> the Apostle of the Gentiles, whose ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Jewes, his kindred in the flesh, and endeavours for their conversion to Christ, is very notable and may shame us now adayes, who so little minde the advancement and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs kingdome, or the salvation and welfare of our kindred and posterity.</p>
               <p>In his divine and learned Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he stiles the beleeving <hi>Romans</hi> brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. and Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7. as he doth also other Gentiles frequently in his Epistles, to shew that though he was a Jew by nature, yet hee accounts such his especiall brethren as are the called of Christ, for whom he is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in prayer, and all Apostolicall duties in the service of God in the Gospell of his Sonne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 6. to 10. whereby he seemes to insinuate into their affections, to make way afterward to the discovery of this great mystery of the Jewes conversion in the later dayes, that they might be one in Christ and be saved with them, which should be both his, and their earnest prayers and utmost endeavours for the spreading and enlarging of Christs kingdome, as he could even wish himselfe separate from Christ for his kinsmen after the flesh, the Jewes, to whom belong so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priviledges, as the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the service of God, the promises, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4, 5. yet showes that the priviledges of fleshly generation from <hi>Abraham,</hi> availe them not, for all not <hi>Israel</hi> which are of <hi>Israel,</hi> and quotes a place of <hi>Isa. cap.</hi> 10. 12. that onely a remnant shall be saved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they sought not after righteousnesse, by faith in the Lord
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:112554:48"/> Jesus but by the workes of the Law, they stumbled and fell and Christ became to them a rocke of offence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. 32. In the 10. Chapter he declares (vers. 1. and so forward) his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and prayer for his kinsmen the Jewes, that they might bee saved, and showes the lets and hinderances that lie in this way, as mainly their ignorance of righteousnesse by Christ, and thence going about to establish their owne righteousnesse, and that though they had heard the sound of all the Prophets going to the ends of the earth concerning Christ, yet understood them not; he shewes another way whereby their conversion shall bee partly accomplished, from a saying of <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 32. 21. I will provoke them to jealousie by them that are no people, and anger them by a foolish nation, <hi>Rom,</hi> 10. 19.</p>
               <p>In the 11. <hi>chap. vers.</hi> 1, &amp;c. he declares that these poore Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse creatures, are not yet left hopelesse, are not cast-aways, have not so stumbled as to fall for ever: no, God forbid, none are cast off whom God foreknew, for he himselfe is a Jew of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and that there is yet a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of that stocke that belong to the election of grace, Vers. 5. and the rest were blinded, Vers. 7. as it was foretold, <hi>Isa. 29. 10. Isa. 6. 9. Psal.</hi> 69. 22, 23. so that through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousie, and Vers. 12. hee begins to frame severall arguments to evince the truth of their conversion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If their fall be the enriching of the world of Gentiles, how much more their fulnesse? But the first is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the latter. This argument showes there is a time of the Jewes fulnesse shall bring honour and great happinesse to the Gentile Churches, See <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 11. 12. even a new resurrection in a new state of the Church even as life from the dead, <hi>Apoc. 20. 5. Rom.</hi> 11. 15. the Apostle tells the <hi>Romans,</hi> this his endeavour of his kinsmens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version is exceeding advantagious to them and all the Gentiles, in the enlargement of Christs kingdome, the indeavours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he calls a magnifying of his office of his Apostleship, if by any meanes he might provoke them to jealousie and emulation, as before was foretold by <hi>Moses;</hi> this jealousie, is a godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of the favour and love of Christ, as of a chast spouse of her husbands love, lest the Gentiles should wholly goe away with it, and that they might be provoked to emulate our happy estate in the Lord Jesus, wherewith we should provoke the Jewes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:112554:48"/> at this day by holding forth a bright light of Christs shining amongst us in his pure ordinances, as to make them emulate our happinesse, so also to invite them to come and walke in the light of the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Argument from Vers. 16. if the root be holy, then the branches are holy. But the root is holy, <hi>Ergo</hi> the branches, though some broken off by unbeleefe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they be the naturall branches, and there be enough sap, sweetnesse and fatnesse in the root the fruitfull Olive tree to spread and revive the branches, and God able to graffe them in againe, then shall they blossome and bud and flourish againe. But the first is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the second.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we Gentiles, branches of the wild Olive tree, be contrary to nature graffed into the roote of the sweet, fat, and fruitfull Olive tree, much more easie it is for the naturall branches to bee graffed into their owne naturall stocke againe. But the first is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the second.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we Gentiles feed on the fatnesse of the true Olive tree, which should refresh and nourish the naturall branches, then shame is it to us to engrosse it to our selves and not to allure them to partake of our sweetnesse, how should we love the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for the rootes sake? But the first is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the second.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the gifts and calling of God be without repentance, and he God who cannot lie or deny himself, but that his Counsells shall stand, and all that belong to the election of grace be saved, then how hard so ever it seeme in mens eyes, it shall be yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, for they are beloved for the Fathers sake. But the first is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the second.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If wee in times past in unbeliefe have obtained mercy through their unbeliefe, then these naturall branches though now in unbeleefe, shall through the same mercy in our beleefe obtaine mercy, But the first is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the second.</p>
               <p>From many such arguments the Apostle insinuates the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Jewes againe, into the heads and hearts of the beleeving <hi>Romans,</hi> to move us Gentles to further this great work, which shall be such an inriching to all the Gentile Churches, as a new resurrection to a new life in a new estate of the Church and world, even as life from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15. Therefore saith <hi>Paul,</hi> I would not have you ignorant brethren of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, lest ye be puffed up, or wise in your owne conceipts, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:112554:49"/> blindnesse in part (not totall and finall) is happened to <hi>Israel,</hi> untill the fulnesse of the Gentiles come in, and so all <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved as it is written, (<hi>viz. Isa.</hi> 59. 20.) Out of <hi>Zion</hi> shall come the Deliverer, and shall take away iniquities from <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 12. The Lord shall inherit <hi>Judah</hi> his portion in the holy land, and shall chuse <hi>Jerusalem</hi> againe. Be silent O all flesh before the Lord, for he is raised up out of the habitation of his holinesse, <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. Behold with what a sweet Epiphonema or joyfull acclamation of spirit and great admiration, here the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> concludes this great mystery, as <hi>Paul</hi> also in this Epistle, <hi>Rom. 11. 33. O the depth of the riches of the wisedome and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgements, and his wayes past finding out!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Paul</hi> treating of this mystery lookes upon the old prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, so wee from <hi>Pauls</hi> Evangelicall testimony, are led to the Prophets, where observe by the way in reading of the prophecies of <hi>Isay, Ieremy, Ezekiel, &amp;c.</hi> the things concerning Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are of two sorts. First, such as are said in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be fulfilled: Many whereof are but in part fulfilled, and shall be more clearely fulfilled in the kingdome of Christ among the Jewes; that which is but darkely seene to be fulfilled in his first comming, shall be more gloriously seene and fulfilled in his second comming in his kingdome. Secondly, many things that are fulfilled in a spirituall sense, shall be more clearely fulfilled in the literall sense, as having a further eye towards the Jewes, and the visible glory of Christs kingdome upon earth. Yea wee may say truely that all shall be fulfilled then more gloriously, so as wee must looke for other and clearer interpretations of the Prophets then hitherto is found in most expositors.</p>
               <p>It seemes the Jewes shall be in their greatest distresse about the time of their conversion, as dead men out of minde laid in the dust, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 19. and dead in sinne, especially under that mortall blow of that guilt of crucifying the Lord of life, saying in themselves, Our bones are dryed, our hope is lost, and wee are cut of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 11. they shall seeme to bee forsaken, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 14. but behold, saith the Lord, I will open your graves and cause you come out and bring you to your owne land, and yee shall know that I am the Lord, and that for my names sake I doe all this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 19. 22. And they shall passe through great troubles, hard bestead and hungry, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 21. soule-starved for want of a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:112554:49"/> Saviour, the onely bread of life, they shall fret themselves, and curse their King and their God, (<hi>i. e.</hi> in anguish of soule curse their conceited Messias they have so long leaned on, and to their heart griefe and losse so long waited for) and seeing themselves so soully deceived they shall looke upward, O now for a Christ, what would not poore wandring Christlesse creatures doe now to see a lovely looke of a Saviour! and when they looke to the earth they see nothing but trouble and darkenesse, dimnesse and anguish, and shall be driven to darkenesse, yet not such darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as of old, <hi>Isa. 8. 21. 22. Jer.</hi> 3. 23. 25. but a darkenesse of trouble and anguish of spirit they shall get out of in a little time by the lovely looke of Christ upon them; for what can be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkenesse then to want Christ the light of the world, <hi>John</hi> 14. 7. and life of men, <hi>John</hi> 1. And then in those dayes the children of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> together shall come, going and weeping shall they goe and seeke <hi>Jehovah</hi> their God, they shall aske the way to <hi>Zion</hi> with their faces thither-ward, saying, Come let us joyne our selves to Jehovah in a perpetuall covenant that shall not be forgotten, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5. And when they shall thus seek after Christ in distresse and anguish of spirit, he will powre out his spirit upon them, and they shall looke upon him whom they have pierced, and mourne for him in bitternesse as one mourneth for his onely sonne, <hi>Zach. 12. 10. Apoc.</hi> 1. 7. Happy those Churches that shall shine most brightly in the glory of Christs kingly power, and puritie of his worship, and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; happy those ministers of Christ, who <hi>Paul</hi>-like shall magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their office, in holding out a bright light of lovely Jesus to these poore wandring Christlesse creatures, and shall use all meanes to bring home this ancient bride, to her devorced hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and further this great and last marriage of the Lambe, when he shall stretch out the cords and enlarge his love bed, to the ends of the earth, to take in his old beloved bride, from all the foure windes, with all her virgins and damsels, when his house shall be exalted upon the top of the mountaines, and all nations flow in into it, and flocke into his kingdome; these that shall be instruments to further this great worke, shall be called to the marriage supper of the Lambe, and eate of his delicates, they shall have a sumptuous feast, not for a meale, for a day, a moneth or a yeare, but such a feast as shall last to carry them

               <p>That this place, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. is clearely meant of a new restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewes, and not of that out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Zorobabell;</hi> Is cleare, in that the Jewes were not then carryed into <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> or any of these remote Regions here mentioned, but is clearely from the former part of the Chapter, spoken of their last, and greatest deliverance in the time of Christs Kingdome, and as yet unaccomplished: Besides, the Lord wrought no such wonders, (as here mentioned) at the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Therefore, this great wonder is yet to come.</p>
               <p>And when the Lord Jesus goes about it in the next Verse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 12. he will set up a signe to the Nations: (So <hi>Tremel.</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, not ensigne as our Translation hath it) this signe is a signe of great astonishment to the Nations, and amazement to all the world, (as signes betoken great wonders, strange things to follow, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 1. to 10.) And as a signe of astonishment to the world, to all the enemies of his Church especially: So may it be as a Beacon, to guide these poore wandring Jewes, to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> againe from all quarters, as the Starre in the East gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:112554:52"/> the wise men from <hi>Chaldea</hi> or <hi>Persia,</hi> to <hi>Judea,</hi> and to the very Towne of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to worship Christ there, this Starre was not ordinary, but extraordinary: and if Christ used such an extraordinary signe to bring in these wise men (whom <hi>Calvin</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. calls the first fruites of the Gentiles) what a wonderfull signe will this be, that shall gather in the dispersed of <hi>Israel,</hi> from all the foure corners of the earth, his old beloved people, deare in his affection?</p>
               <p>And their comming shall be in great unity and concord, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim shall not envy Judah, &amp;c.</hi> verse 13.

               <p>And in the next verse, the Lord prepares a way for their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage<note place="margin">

The Lord shall utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian Sea, (or mouth of the Egyptian Sea, that like a tongue flowes into the River betweene the bankes, as betweene the chaps of the hils on each side) and with his mighty wind, shake his hand over the River and smite it in the seven streames thereof, and make men goe over dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shod, or in shooes.

               <p>This River is without doubt <hi>Nylus</hi> which is the great River of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and watereth it by his floods, and overflowings, and as Authors report, hath seven streames flowing from severall heads out of the Mountaines on several parts of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> in the South, and fals into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the chiefe City of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which the Lords hand shall smite in the seven streames of it, with a mighty wind, suppose some strange whirlewind, raised miraculously, for which the Lords mighty hand is in it, shall cast the waters upon the bankes, or drive it out into the Sea, and smite the mouth of the River also, that the Sea shall not be able to flow in, but all shall runne out, untill a dry and safe passage be made here for his people to come over in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, with Camels and Horses, with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Cattle, and Carriages, out of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and those Southerne Regions; as by the drying up of <hi>Euphrates,

To which the Prophet here alludes in setting forth the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Lord Jesus will doe to bring home this his wandring people to a place of their owne againe, that they may move no more, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
               <p>This Exposition we have confirmed from <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 12, 13. the words are plaine and cleare to this purpose. In that day it shall come to passe, that the Lord shall beate off from the channell of that River, (<hi>i. e. Euphrates</hi>) unto the streame of <hi>Aegypt, (i. e. Nylus</hi>) and ye shall be gathered one by one O ye children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and it shall come to passe in that day, that the great Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet (as <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. 7. and 11. 15. The sound of the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, when the mystery of God shall be fulfilled) shall be blowne (or sounded) and they shall come which were ready to perish in the Land of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and the outcasts in the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and shall worship Jehovah in his holy Mountaine at <hi>Jerusalem. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> lies in their way from <hi>Assyria,</hi> and the Easterne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and <hi>Nylus</hi> in their way out of <hi>Aegypt, Ethiopia,</hi> and all the South, which shall now be made a dry passage for them to their owne Country againe on both sides, See <hi>Zephania</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>Thus we see what great wonders this Arme of the Lord shall doe when he stretches it out the second time, when it shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and put on strength, as in the daies of old: Art not thou that same Arme that hath cut <hi>Rabab (i. e. Aegypt, Psalm.</hi> 89. 10.) and wounded the head of the Dragon? (<hi>i. e. Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Ezek.</hi> 29. 3.) art thou it (<hi>i. e.</hi> that same Arme) that dryed up the Sea, and made the great deepe a way for the ransomed to passe over? (as <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21.) then the redeemed of the Lord shall come to <hi>Zion,</hi> with songs and everlasting Joy upon their heads, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 9▪ 10, 11. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 27, where the Prophet also speakes clearely of the Jewes conversion. When the Lord shall say unto the North, Give, and to the South, Keepe not backe, bring my Sonnes from farre, and my Daughters from the ends of the earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 4. it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth who brought his people out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but the Lord liveth, who brought his people out of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:112554:53"/> Land of the North, and out of all the Countries where he scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Thus by these other Scriptures we have the right sense and meaning of this notable place, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 11. of the great wonders the Lord Jesus will worke for his ancient peoples restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And then in the next Chapter, <hi>Isa.</hi> 12. we finde the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant song of the Church for this great deliverance, and joy in the high workes of Christ. Then shall the new created people, (verse 19. of our Psalme) praise <hi>Jah.</hi> The trophees of triumphs over the great enemies, and songs of victory over the Beast and his Image, and joyes and praises in the Churches, after these great deliverances, and glorious advancement of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the building of <hi>Zion,</hi> it seemes are reserved to the time of the Jewes full conversion, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 1. to 6. &amp; 15. 3.</p>
               <p>Observe by the way, the Churches fervent prayers in bitter troubles end in high praises. Then n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Exod. 15. 2. Psa.</hi> 118. 14.</p>
               <p>It is probable that in those dayes the Jewes shall amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, be restored to the use of the Tabrets, and Harps, with Tymbrels and Daunces, to solemnize the great deliverance (<hi>Isa. 30. 29. 32.

Exod. 15. 20. Psal. 81. 2. Judg. 11. 34. 1 Chron. 13. 8. 2 Sam. 6. 5. 1 Sam. 18. 6. Jerusalem</hi> shall be againe adorned with her Tabrets, and goe forth in the dances of them that make merry, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 4.</p>
               <p>There shall be voyces of Joy and melody with thanksgiving in all the Churches, when the Lord shall comfort <hi>Zion, Isa.</hi> 51. 3. They shall come to <hi>Zion</hi> with singing, with everlasting joy and gladnesse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 11. and chap. 35. 10. all the Churches sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and re-sounding the high praises of God in his great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>And in those dayes these victorious triumphant songs of the Church, shall be composed with most exquisite art and skill,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:112554:54"/> and sung with ravishing delight, and melody. As farre beyond all former songs of <hi>Moses, Dehorah</hi> or any times of the Church as these high workes of Christ shall exceed all the former: and so the greatest workes shall have the highest praises.</p>
               <p>Meane while the courteous Reader may please to peruse these few lines of praises composed for our recreation, in these sad times of troubles, and in thankfulnesse of minde and Spirit to our Jehovah in the darke sight a farre off, he hath pleased to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part concerning those his high and excellent workes approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apace in the world.

There shall be many <hi>Johns</hi> (saith bright <hi>Brightman</hi>) who in the latter dayes, shall leave all their owne possessions, &amp; habitations, to take a full &amp; delightful view of this holy City, not in a superstitious manner, as pilgrims use to goe to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous materiall <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> now under the guilt of the blood of Christ, and so a sad spectacle to behold, untill it be renewed and made new.</p>
                        <p>Thus have we had a little view of this stately Bride, the Lambs wife, decked and adorned for the marriage of the Lambe, those who desire and delight in a more full view of her beauty and glory, read Master <hi>Brightman</hi> upon <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.</p>
                        <p>In the next place this marriage of the Lambe, wants not its so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, sutable to this our royall <hi>Solomons</hi> espousals, there shall be ravishing Musicke, and the Marriage song with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and melody.</p>
                        <p>First, the sweet musicke is great delight in the Bridegroomes voyce, <hi>John</hi> 3. 29. wherewith the Bride and her traine and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants shall be exceedingly joyed and ravished, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 12. and <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 13. The companions (or Virgins the Brides attendants) hearken to thy voyce, O cause me to heare it (saith the Bride) as never enough to be heard againe and againe, because of her great delight in it.</p>
                        <p>The voyce of the Bride, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 10. shall be most sweete in the eares of all her attendants. I will wholly delight in Jehovah, and my spirit shall exceedingly joy in my God: and all the other particular Churches shall joyne with the Bride in this sweete
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:112554:63"/> voyce, from henceforth perpetually sounding out their delight in the sincere worship and faith of Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The marriage Song is sung of the Bridegroomes friends, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 29. his paranymphes, who have furthered this new Marriage, and the comming home of the ancient Spouse the Jewes: these Bridegroomes friends, who sing this wedding song, are the pure Churches of the Gentiles, that have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lambe through great tribulations, and stucke close to Christ in the sharpest tryalls and sorest troubles, who have not beene defiled with the filthy pollutions of the whorish Woman, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 1. nor lacquyed after the times, but kept the word of his patience, and have had a deare love to the Lambe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2. these Bridegroomes friends are they that be come out of great tribulations, companions with Christ in his sufferings, shall be brought into the Kings presence, into the Bride chambers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. and be the chiefe singers of this nuptiall Song, with hearts boyling within them for vent, full of heavenly and high medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the excellencies of the Bridegroome and Bride, with high praises and commendations, wherein her tongue runnes swiftly, as the pen of a swift Writer, with a voyce tuned sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Nightingale, to quaver out her severall straines of joyes, in praises of Christ and his kingdome, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 1, 2.</p>
                        <p>This Marriage Song we finde clearely written before-hand, by the spirit of God, the divine penmans skilfull hand, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. a type of our Royal <hi>Solomons</hi> espousals, &amp; must be fulfilled what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is written of him in the Law and Prophets, and in the <hi>Psalmes, Luke</hi> 24. 44. And by the Judgment of the learned, this Psalme is a Propheticall song of the Marriage of Christ and his Church, and then it must be surely belonging to this last mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as the things following will show, as the daughter of <hi>Tyre</hi> bringing presents, verse 12. and of the children of this marryed Bride, who shall be Princes in all the Earth, which sets forth the spreading of Christs kingdome in all the world, and subjecting the rich Nations to his obedience, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet fulfilled in the Marriage with us poore Gentiles, who have yet seene little of his kingdome and conquests, but rather suffering and subjection under Princes and rich Nations. So then, this Psalme is cleare to be belonging to the time of Christs visible kingdome and marriage of the Lambe. And so we come to some observations from the Psalme it selfe, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 45. 1.</p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:112554:63"/>
                        <p>To the chiefe Musitian upon the Lillies, saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This divine Love-song is committed to the Sonnes of <hi>Core,</hi> sons of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father, who perished with <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> yet these sons devout and godly men, endowed with excellent gifts, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a holy Office, to be the chiefe singers, in the Temple, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26. And in as much as it is called a Song for instruction, it shews us that much is to be learned in it; and from the stately stile of the Song, <hi>Calvin</hi> observes, that this is no ordinary matter, the Holy Ghost (saith he) useth not to puffe up mens cheekes with a vaine sound, but with some high and mysticall matter excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, which hath not beene heard of.</p>
                        <p>The common interpretation of this Song, hath beene long in the Church applyed to <hi>Solomons</hi> marriage with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, set forth in allegoricall phrases, as in the type of Christ and his Church; but that sense, first, fals too short of the ayme of the Spirit: secondly, there was no one thing in that marriage of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that can hold ground in the Mystery of the type, which <hi>Paul</hi> applies to Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8, 9. and so reaches unto Christ, as principally pertaining to him: and if to Christ, to what time of Christ, but this marryage of the Lambe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his Kingdome, which is yet to come, as before?</p>
                        <p>And so these Paranymphs or Bridegroomes friends, beginne the first straine of their Song in high exalted termes of praise, and commendation of the Bridegroome, verse 2. his person and lovely beauty, and then his eloquence, and then of his actions and Kingly vertues, and graces; then of the glory of his Throne and Kingdome, and the beauty and glory of the new Church, and high commendations of the Bride.</p>
                        <p>The first straine is of the Bridegroomes person, Thou art fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:112554:64"/> then the children of Men, full of lovely beauty, above all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> the chiefe of ten thousands, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. his lookes are lovely, and most worthy of the Brides most choyce and best affections, his worth, noble disposition, and Kingly vertues shine forth in his very countenance. And in this faire and lovely beauty of his, faire, white, and ruddy, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. above all sonnes of men, the Paranymphes, with ravishing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light behold, and also sweetly sing out the high praise of his pure innocence in himselfe, his righteousnesse and free mercy, and pure love to his Saints, shining in his pure whitenesse; and whereas, to make up this fairenesse and beauty, there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ruddinesse, wherein the Church beholds and sings out the praise of his Justice, and vengeance now executed upon all her enemies, and his wrath and angry countenance now remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ended in their overthrow, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 25. So as now they set him out highly, in all lovely, pleasant, and ravishing beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to allure the Bride, the new Church of the Jewes to set her full delight upon this lovely Bridegroome her King, as in an extasie, assuring her by all these insinuations, she shall find much more in him, then can be expressed.</p>
                        <p>In the next straine of this Song, they sing out highly his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull language and eloquence. Grace is powred into thy lips. The gracious words that come out of his mouth full of admiration, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 22. wherewith his lippes drop downe pure Myrrhe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 13. Sweet and delightfull to allure the Bride to his obedience, who will let her want nothing may accrew to her happinesse, for he is one whom the Father hath blessed, and that for ever, and in whom all fulnesse dwels, and of this the Bridegroomes friends assure the Bride, from their experience of the kisses of his mouth, and savour of his ointments, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. of all refreshing soule-fatting graces, they have found in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, and dayly fresh and springing in this sweet and fat Olive tree, by long experience of 1600. yeares and more, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and alluring this new Bride to taste of their delicates that grow and blossome in his Garden, from the word of his mouth, and sweet breathings of his Spirit.</p>
                        <p>Their next commendation is of his triumphant riding, sets out the remembrance of his victories, and valiant acts, ver. 3, 4, 5. the glory and stability of his Throne and Kingdome, his government with great Majesty, Justice, and equity, in great
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:112554:64"/> state and princely magnificence, above all the glory of all the Potentates in the world, verse 6, 7. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 6. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 28. The delight the Saints finde in his sweet smelling garments, garments of righteousnesse, garments of salvation, whereby he hath wrought his Churches wonderfull deliverance, wherein he himselfe is glad, and the Church much delighted, smelling sweetly, as of Aloes and Cassia, (whereof the Incense was made <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 21.) signifying his mediation, and intercession and offerings of his blood and prayers, shall now smell sweetly in the pure Churches, here set out in a stately Portraiture as of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory Palaces, when this great King comes forth to his Bride, in his royall Robes, whereby he hath both wrought her salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and great deliverance, wherein he is glad and much deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his great workes, and which must needs engage the Brides affections dearely to him, this we find, ver. 8.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the high praise of the Bridegroome.</p>
                        <p>The next straine of their song is of the glory and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Bride, sutable to the state of such a Bridegroom, and that we find from verse 9. to the end.</p>
                        <p>The first glory of the Bride in her Royall attendants, Kings Daughters of heathen Nations, new Converts, shall helpe to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnise this great Marriage. Next in the placing of the Bride at the Kings right hand, the place of greatest honour, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 19. 3. in her attire very stately, of Gold of Ophire, or India, gay and glistering in glory of her ornaments of all pure ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, verse 9. The glorious Mysteries of Christs kingdome, are set forth to us in various similitudes and figures of earthly things, to helpe our weake capacities, as when we read of Ivory palaces, Gold, sweet perfumes, pretious stones, and sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring oyntments, they set forth the glory and abundant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of gifts and graces, and beautifull worship and government, wherewith the Lord Jesus dignifies and adornes his Church.</p>
                        <p>These paranymphs ver. 10, 11, 12. seeme to let their voyce fall a little, of their commendations of the Bride, and direct some speeches, or exhortations to her. Hearken O Daughter, (meaning the Bride, the Lambes wife, the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as <hi>Ainsworth</hi> expounds it) and consider, and be content to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thy Fathers house, and all the fashions of it, all the houses of Idols, corruptions, Jewish superstitions▪ rites, and shadowes of <hi>Mosaicall</hi> worship, now a blind Religion and vanished, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:112554:65"/> looke upon and cleave to thy Bridegroome, in whom all these are fulfilled, as a Bride must leave all, friends and Fathers house, and cleave to her husband, <hi>Gen. 4. 24. Matth.</hi> 10. 37. Hearken now and encline thine eare and cleave to him, and then will he delight in thy beauty, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. and <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 4. and thou shalt be honoured of all rich and wealthy Nations, the daughter of <hi>Tyre</hi> shall bring presents, and rich people shall intreate thy favour and promote thy welfare: <hi>Tyre</hi> here is brought in by a Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche for many wealthy Nations, for <hi>Tyre</hi> was the most rich and flourishing State in the world in those dayes, as <hi>Ezek. 27. Isa.</hi> 23. 8. and 60. 1. 11. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 24. 26.</p>
                        <p>Then these Bridegroomes friends, verse 13. seeme to raise their voyces againe in a high straine of praise of the Bride, of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beauty, and outward glory and magnificence, The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, with inward graces, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 16. and her outward cloathing with rich and costly ornaments of pure ordinances, glistering in the eyes of all the world; her cloathing is of wrought or broydered Gold, adorned and beset with Jewels and pretious stones, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 10, 11. and chap. 54. 11, 12. shewes her excellent fruites of her inward graces, shining before men, full of delight and great variety, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                        <p>The Bride thus stately decked shall be brought forth to the King the Bridegroome in great state and magnificence, set forth againe in another stately habit, beseeming the state of so great a King in rayment of needle-worke, or garments of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously broydered with severall colours wrought with needle, signifies the same variety of gifts and graces, set forth before in other similitudes, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 10. to 14. and to augment her state she is brought forth with her Virgins and Bride Maydes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to the greater solemnising of this great and divine wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with great joy and rejoycing: these Virgins and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Bride are the converts of the heathen Nations that shall attend on this glorious Bride, and come flocking into Christs kingdome, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 8. and this we have verse 14. of this 45. <hi>Psalme,</hi> and verse 15. we finde the Bride brought home with all her state and troopes of attendants, with great joy and gladnesse, into the Kings palace, the stately structure in the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Tabernacle of God with men, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the midst of them. And not onely into the Kings palace, but she shall be brought into the Kings Chambers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:112554:65"/> his presence, of secret delights, hid from the world, and the safest and quietest roome in his palace, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 20. and into the beds of Spices, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 1. where the immortall seed of the word is sowne, and becomes very spreading and fruitfull, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 23. whereby multitudes of soules are begot to God, to the spreading and flourishing of Christs kingdome, as in the next verse, v. 16. Instead of thy Fathers shall thy children be, who shall be Princes in all the earth; loe here a rich reward of her forsaking her Fathers house and fashions there, she shall have an honourable spreading off-spring, to the ends of the earth; new Converts of all Nations, and farre remote Countries that shall be as Kings and Princes, having great dominion in all the earth: in summe, rule the whole world, with excellent glory in princely vertues, and eminent graces, and greatnesse of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as the stars of heaven for multitude, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 17. farre transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all her forefathers, in any age of the world.</p>
                        <p>And so verse 17. and last, those Bridegroomes friends shut up this delightfull Song, with a perfumed remembrance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, this glorious Bride shall henceforth obtaine in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, throughout all ages and Generations for ever, that is, to the worlds end. Which no way agrees with <hi>Solomons</hi> Bride, or yet himselfe, who rather deserved to have his memory and name blotted out for his strange wives and Idolatry, nor did ever his posterity so spread in renowne through all the earth, but on the contrary, his son by following ill counsels, lost ten parts of his kingdome. So that from the beginning to the end, we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see this triumphant Marriage Song to belong to Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and last Marriages of the Jewes and heathen.</p>

                        <p>When he, this Sunne of Righteousnesse arises and appeares In his glory, his glory spreads irresistibly, as the Sunne beames cast rayes of brightnesse to the ends of the earth.</p>
                        <p>First, We have seene him wonderfull glorious, in himselfe; first, in his person and princely parts; secondly, in his Kingly Titles, very glorious; thirdly, in his apparell; fourthly, in his stately riding; and fifthly, in his royall attendants, very Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we have seene him very glorious in his noble acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; first, great conquests of his enemies; secondly, in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Zion,</hi> and setting up his kingdome gloriously, or in great glory: first, of Liberty; secondly, in a healing glory; thirdly, in glorious brightnesse, and beauty, fit for the marriage of the Lambe; fourthly, glorious in fruitfulnesse and encrease of all inward and outward gifts and graces, and innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of beleevers and new converts, Kings, and Princes, and great ones, of all rankes and qualities; fifthly, accompanyed with glorious peace and plenty; sixthly, under his glorious and wonderfull protection and safety; seventhly, in a glorious estate of stability and perpetuity.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, But the extent of his noble actions and spreading of this his glory to the ends of the earth, is the wonder of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to see that accomplished, this shall make up the top of his glory, and the Churches Joy, now he will be as good as his word, all now shall be accomplished that he hath promised to be fulfilled in this world, now the Church sets out her breasts to all Nations, to sucke and be satisfied with her consolations, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 11. now she hath asked and received, and her joyes made full, <hi>John</hi> 16. 24. she can aske no more, but to be gone home with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to his Fathers mansions, where her cup shall so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally runne over, as she shall never be able to drinke it downe or diminish it in the least measure.</p>
                        <p>Now of the large extent of his kingdome and glory, we will speake somewhat, and that but briefely, of his spreading glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in all Lands, and so returne to our Text againe.</p>

               <p>The Church findes here such sweet refreshing and delight in the Lord Jesus his unchangeablenesse for ever (the onely revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of her fainting spirits) that she repeates it over and over againe, as never enough to be delighted in, as the foundation of her comfort and confidence in midst of the great unheard of changes and alterations that she yet foresees to fall out in the world, but from her Jehovahs unchangeablenesse she gathers strength of assurance, that all these changes, and troubles, and turning upside downe of all things in the world shall all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and serve to accomplish the great worke of Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in her glory; she ascribes the great Creation of all the world here to the Lord Jesus as Coeternall with the Father, and the Spirit, <hi>John 1. 2. 3. Isa.</hi> 48. 12. who as they consulted together to give her being in the first creating of the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. she is now confident will consult together to worke out her promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed restauration in the glory of his kingdome, by all such wayes and meanes as his counsells of old have determined, <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 1. and all the changes that shall fall out are but effects of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree, and deepe counsells, who changes not but abides the same for ever, the first and the last, the beginning and the end, without shadow of changing, <hi>James 1. 17. Apoc.</hi> 1. 8. Thou art the same and thy yeares have no end. These changes and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here spoken of in our <hi>Psalme,</hi> wee finde clearely applyed to the time of Christs kingdome, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10. 11. in the very words here in our <hi>Psalme,</hi> as we shall see more clearely in the things following.</p>
               <p>The maine difficultie here is in the changes here foretold, and these changeable things, of heavens and earth, what thereby is meant and to what times applyed, which shall be our indeavour to fetch light from the Scriptures to discover, that the changes here spoken of are not meant of the <hi>matter of heaven and earth,</hi> or the materiall elementary heavens &amp; earth at the end of the world, for they shall not then be changed but wholly destroyed by fire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. and resolved to nothing, but of the change not of the matter or substance of the present frame of the world, but of a change of qualities and accidents, a making of all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:112554:75"/> as Christ himselfe saith, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 5. a new face of the Church and of the world and all things in it, in stead of the hitherto state of the Church and world so full of troubles and oppression under mightie enemies, a state of the Church and world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dwelleth righteousnesse, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 13. Apoc.</hi> 21. 1. which cannot be meant of heaven eternall, for there is no earth there; againe this change from old to new Heavens and new Earth is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promise, but we finde no promise of any such change; but <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17. and 66. 22. which clearely doe speake of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Christs kingdome among the Jewes, as so great a worke as a new Creation of new Heavens and new Earth, a new frame of the world after the old frame is broken downe with Earthquakes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 24. 19, 20. a new face of all things in the Church, and in the world, a new Heaven-like state of the Church, and a new frame of the world for a new habitation for this new created people, Vers. 19. of our <hi>Psalme.</hi> So that the change of Heavens and Earth here, Vers. 27. is such as they shall not utterly perish in, but in regard of the opposition to Christ who is without shadow of changing, their change is a seeming perishing, for it shall be such a change they shall suffer, as shall set a new face upon all things, a state equivalent to perishing, as the words clearely evince, Vers. 27. both the Church-state and the world shall suffer such a change as the former Heaven and Earth, that is, the troublesome state thereof shall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, <hi>Isa. 65. 17. Apoc.</hi> 21. 1. but be buried in oblivion; all former glory of any thing that could bee gloried in in the Church or world, shall be swallowed up in the glory of the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and new Earth, in the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> of the Jewes.</p>
               <p>That this is no new thing that often in the Scripture Heaven is meant of the state of Church, and Earth of the world, See <hi>Isa.</hi> 44 23. and <hi>cap. 49. 3. Isa. 13. 13.

Ezek.</hi> 39. 16. the body of the Army lying by the Sea of <hi>Gennesaret,</hi> otherwise called the lake of <hi>Tiberias, Ezek.</hi> 39. 11. no wonder was it to see the poore Church in a swound or qualme, fainted and gone almost to see these troubles, great changes afar off in the spirit of Prophecy, as Vers. 24.</p>
               <p>Another place which may give us light in these changes in the world, our Psalmist speaks of, is <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 6. where we have the very words of our 102. <hi>Psalme:</hi> the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> throughout the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:112554:76"/> speakes clearely of the Jewes conversion and the Churches glory flourishing in all felicitie, as <hi>Eden,</hi> as the garden of God, Vers. 3. compared with, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 7. and 22. 14. where Paradise is clearely meant of Christs kingdome in this world, in the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all the enemies in the two last Verses, before which great worke can be effected it will produce great and wonderfull chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, such as the Prophet stirres us up to behold afarre off with amazement, Vers. 6. Lift up your eyes to the heavens and looke upon the earth below, for the heavens shall vanish like smoake, (<hi>i. e.</hi> bee made blacke with troubles, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 3.) and vanish as smoake, soone gone and no more remembred, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17. and the earth wax old as a garment, (that is, the men of the earth and glory of the earth and earthly dignities signified by the next words) and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner, for the moth shall eate them up like a garment, and the worme shall eate them as wooll (signifies a consumption determined upon the whole earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 22. as before it had done his people for their sinnes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 23. to the end, this consumption shall now come upon the enemies) for the Lord Jesus his righteous salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church and plaguing of his enemies shall be for ever, never abolished▪ Vers. 6. 8. of this 51. <hi>Isay,</hi> such judgements shall come upon the enemies as shall seeme to make the earth emptie without forme and voyd, and the heavens have no light, no peace or comfort left almost in the Churches, because of great calamities, as if the whole frame of the world, and course of nature were dissolved in these long and great troubles which the world shall raise against the advancement of Christs kingdome,<note place="margin">Isay 24.</note> laying nations waste and desolate, <hi>Isa. 13. 10.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:112554:77"/> second temple was a type of a surpassing glory above all former glory of the Church in any age.</p>
               <p>So now we see by the light of the Scriptures this change men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in our 102. <hi>Psalme,</hi> in the heavens and earth, is not meant of the end of the world, but of such a change wherein the matter of heaven and earth, or elementary firmament and earth, shall not perish or yet be changed, but onely the qualities and fashion and face of all things in Churches and Commonweales, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Nations, the old rotten frame of all things in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and governments shall bee broken downe in earthquakes, turning all the world upside downe, so as it must bee all made new againe, the old fashion of Church and world being waxen old as a moth-eaten garment, having so many mothes fretting in it as not a sound part left in it, good for any thing, cannot abide a shake or a pull but falls in peeces, therefore it must bee laid by as men doe old cloathes that bee good for nothing, quite worne to peeces, and then he that laid the first foundations of the world, <hi>Isa. 48. 13. Heb.</hi> 1. 2. will make all new againe, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 5. and plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth anew, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 16. as a paradise of all felicitie, clearely meant of the time of the Jewes comming in, and setting up of Christs kingdome in all the world, as appeares vers. 9. 11. the new Church of the Jewes being called the planting of the Lord, the worke of his hands, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. 21. and 61. 3. his pleasant plant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 7. when Antichrist and all the enemies are unrooted and fallen in these great earthquakes of troubles, that overturnes the frame and fashion of the whole world and all things in it, there shall bee a blessed change, and new face of all things, a new foundation and frame of all the whole Creation, as the very creatures shall partake of this new estate of restauration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22. and <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. as we shewed before; this is clearely implyed in our <hi>Psalme,</hi> Thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed, that is, made new; new heavens and new earth, and the former shall not bee remembred, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17. a new creation for the new created people, Vers. 19. of our <hi>Psalme,</hi> a new habitation, a new life, life from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15. a new resurrection out of the dust of a low condition, <hi>Isa. 26. 19. Apoc.</hi> 20. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>This state of the Church and of the world had need be a new creation, because men are so carnall and sensuall and wedded to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:112554:77"/> their owne phantasies, old customes and formes of worship, and all things of the frame of their owne braines in matters of the Church and of religion, so opposite to spirituall things, that God must create the glorious state of the Church he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, out of nothing, yea out of contraries, and with such a power as no creature can resist, such a worke is Creation out of a Chaos, of all confusion and nothingnesse, the whole frame and fabricke of this new world must be a creation above all mens capacity or imagination, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 5. and 65. 18. a worke onely fit for the art and skill of so brave a workeman, for the honour of so great a king, the creatour of <hi>Israel, Isa.</hi> 43. 15.</p>
               <p>And that this creation of new heavens and new earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17. is meant of the state of the new <hi>Jerusalem, Apoc.</hi> 21. comming downe from God out of heaven, so not of heaven of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints, for it comes down from God out of it; besides what the glory of that heaven shall be, is not revealed, <hi>Paul</hi> who was taken up into Paradise, tells us no more but this, they are such as eye hath not seene, eare heard, or entred into the heart of man to understand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 29. it is said he heard such things as might not be uttered, it may be if he understood any thing of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant state of the Church in perfect glory, he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded silence, and therefore wee have nothing to doe to enquire where the word of God is silent.</p>
               <p>It is the glorious state of the new Church, wee have leave to looke into, and are invited to come and see into this new created glory of the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> of the Jewes, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 9. which wee finde in this new creation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 8. in the beginnings and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings, and in the glory and perfection of it, <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. to the end of the Chapter, and Chap. 66. Vers. 6. to the end.</p>
               <p>In the beginnings, of gathering in the remnant of that holy seed, as the new wine in the cluster of grapes not yet pressed forth, not knowne in its excellency before the vintage, a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the elect that shall inherit the holy mountaine, (out all the 12.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:112554:78"/> before, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 9.) shall bee a fold for their flockes, and the valley of Achor, a place for heards to lie downe in; this valley of <hi>Achor</hi> the place where <hi>Achan</hi> was stoned with his sonnes, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7. 26. is now promised them for a dore of hope, <hi>Hosea</hi> 2 17. or hopefull entrance into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as it was of old, a fruitfull valley affording them much comfort and refreshing in their returne out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Wildernesse, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of which now againe this second and last returne, is a ground of hopefull possession of their owne land againe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they shall have this sweet refreshing entrance, after a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and long travaile out of the North, and East, and South, and utmost regions of the world; the rest or second part of the Chapter is of the Churches glorious estate from, Vers. 17. to the end, in such a flourishing condition as never was in the world, we have spoken at large in the things wee have passed through, and so we hasten now to an end. Thus by the comming in of the Jewes great glory and benefit shall be unto all the true Gentile beleevers, if their fall was the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulnesse? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. that is, there is a time of the Jewes fulnesse shall wonderfully enrich the whole world of the beleeving Gentiles, in a new world, a paradise of all felicity for soule and body, as long as the world endures, in a new life as life from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
               <p>Let none now stumble at this kind of speech of the state of those times approaching in the glory of Christs kingdome, to be a new world, A golden age, as if all were novelties, phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and fables, No, no, it is as antient as <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> (the two great lights of these late times) to rise no higher, as some do even to the primitive times, yea as old as the Apostles &amp; Prophets; <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place of <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17. brings in Christ as by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopopeia saying, I have both will &amp; power to deliver my Church &amp; restore her in a such manner as she shall seeme to have a habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a new world; and that the Prophet meanes not of Christs first comming, but of the progresse of his kingdome to his last appearing, and so brings in the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. calling it a new world, the world to come whereof we speake.</p>

               <p>Here the Church hath got out of all her heart-qualmes and her fainting spirits, now fully refreshed concludes triumphantly, with a most sweet Epiphonema or acclamation of joy in her stabilitie, that what changes soever fall out in the world all shall contribute to her happinesse in the end, though the world bee turned upside downe in earthquakes and combustions when those great workes are accomplishing, though the heavens and the earth be changed all former glory of the world vanish as smoake and bee no more remembred, yet she shall bee in a sure condition without any more changes, till she bee translated to glory in eternity, she with her <hi>Zion</hi> borne children (<hi>Psal.</hi> 87. 6.) shall dwell in a stable condition, in a peaceable habitation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 18. and surely they may dwell safely when the Lord Jesus dwells in the midst of them, <hi>Isa. 12. 6. Ezek. 37. 27. Apoc.</hi> 21. In mount <hi>Zion</hi> and in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the place of his praises, as Vers. 22. of this <hi>Psalme,</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 1. where he shall raigne before his antient people gloriously, <hi>Isa. 24. ult.</hi> and the seed of the Church who shall still be borne in <hi>Zion</hi> shall bee established before him, who lives for evermore, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>dwell</hi> is full of sweet Emphasis, implying they shall wander no more, they shall dwell in a place of their owne and move no more, 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 10. Amos</hi> 9. 15. the covenant now made with them is firme and sure as the Rainebow in the Clouds, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 34. 37. the Church shall bee safe and sure doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse when her seed shall be Princes in all the earth, and rule the whole world, <hi>Psal. 45. 16. Dan.</hi> 7. 27. and long enjoy the worke of their hands, <hi>Isay</hi> 65. 22. For as the new heavens and new earth which I will make shall remaine, so shall your seed and name remaine before me, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 21. as long as the Sunne and Moone endures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 5. 17. or to the worlds end, and in such
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:112554:79"/> a state as shall lead the Church to eternity, for she shall have an eternall excellency, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. 15. that is, such as shall last to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and never fade or decay. And in that it is said they are the children and seed of the Church, her legitimate and true borne children that shall enjoy this stable and happy condition with Christ in the later dayes in <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> wee see that all the promises of all this happinesse pertaines alone to such, and not to the rable of hypocrites and false Churches, Arminians, Libertines and all sorts of non-reformists, who reject the Lord Jesus and will not be subject to his Scepter and dominion, but oppose his kingdome and will not admit of a full reformation, that he may rule over them. O the sad newes of a fearefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection long forewarned of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 21, 22. If God spared not the naturall branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the bounty and severitie of God, towards them that fell severity, but towards thee bountifulnesse, if thou continue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or else thou shalt also be cut off.</p>
               <p>Oh sad Catastrophe of these divine mysteries to all unfruitfull Gentile Churches and professed Christians, that have lost their light and love of the truth of right reformation for worldly respects! the unfruitfull Figtree shall be cut downe, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 6. and the vineyard let out to other husbandmen, <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 41. those that glory now adayes so much in the name of the Church, the Church, and looke not after, or will not heare of a full reformation, though now they be accounted as heaven, as pure Churches in their owne eyes and in the eyes of the world, in whose applause they glory, God will gather out his elect from amongst them, and their heaven shall bee folded up as a scroll, out of date, out of use, and left to the Beesome, or to the fire, or as a garment old and moth-eaten, cast away and never partake in the renovation here promised, for giving the Lord Jesus so ill entertainment, be shut out of this new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> into which shall enter no uncircumcised or uncleane, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 1. or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that worketh abomination or maketh a lie, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 27. They have no spirituall eye-sight, who see not great decayes, great defections of late in the Churches called Reformed; and boast of reformation, and yet farre from it, nay it were well if not hinderers of it, and from thence just feares of a wofull se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of many of them from Christ, if they awake not and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:112554:80"/> be zealous and amend. The Lord open our eyes to see the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and beauty of, inflame our hearts with the love of, teach us the great benefits of, and pardon our too much neglect, of searching into, delighting in, and endeavouring for, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs kingdome and glorious brightnesse of <hi>Zions</hi> beauty, which will we, nill wee, shall ere long be the joy of the whole earth, the glory and praise of all the world, <hi>Psal. 48. 2. Isa.</hi> 62. 7. maugre the malice of men and devills, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world, and of hell it selfe.</p>
